					<p>As a recent graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Astrophysics from the Universidad de
						Concepción, my academic journey has been fueled by an unwavering passion for unraveling the
						mysteries of the cosmos. My fascination lies in harnessing the power of data visualization to
						unearth intricate correlations concealed within experimental findings. Presently, I am immersed
						in a captivating role as a researcher within the Astronomy department at my alma mater,
						collaborating closely with a dynamic theory group. Here, I engage in the meticulous realm of
						numerical integrations, orchestrating celestial dynamics experiments that unveil the secrets of
						the universe.
					</p>
					<p>
						With a resolute focus, I am drawn towards the prospect of advancing my academic pursuits through
						a Master's or Ph.D. program that intersects celestial dynamics, numerical integrations, and the
						application of computer science to the realm of astronomy.
					</p>
					<p>
						The boundless potential of data visualization has captivated me, offering a potent lens to
						decipher the enigmatic behavior of
						dynamic systems. I ardently believe that through visualizing data, we can illuminate novel
						connections within experimental outcomes, propelling our understanding to new frontiers.

				<div class="col-md-9">
					<p>My deep fascination with the field of astronomical observation and astrophotography has been an
						enduring flame since my early academic years.
					</p>
					<p>
						As a second year student, I immersed myself fully in the different types of telescopes that the
						Astronomy Department of the Universidad de Concepción owned.A defining facet of my involvement
						has been the collaborative orchestration of enlightening
						discussions, generously accessible to the
						public.
						These enriching dialogues, along with our initiatives encompassing educational forays to rural
						schools and municipalities, marked a stage in which I became fully engaged in fostering the
						understanding and appreciation of astronomy and the night sky.
					</p>
					<p>
						Personally one of the things I most enjoyed during this stage was the integration of our
						community with celestial wonders, meticulously orchestrating captivating displays of solar and
						lunar eclipses in venues of significant community congregation.

					<p>I have this huge love for space, and I'm really excited to share it with all of you. That's why I
						thought of creating a cool Twitch channel. It's like a special online spot where I can show you
						awesome things happening in the sky through my telescope, right as they're happening. The
						channel is getting bigger and bigger, and it's a welcoming place where we can all discover cool
						facts together.
					</p>
					<p>
						We'll talk about things like stars, planets, how they're born, grow, and
						eventually fade away. I'm totally thrilled to answer any questions you might have whether
						they're about space stuff, the tools I use, or the latest space news. It's pretty cool to
						realize that the things we can see up there change every month, like a big cosmic story
						unfolding bit by bit.
					</p>
					<p>
						Currently, I'm using a really strong telescope called eVscope Equinox to
						show you live views. It's like a magical window into the universe that we can all enjoy
						together, right here online!

					<h3 align="center">So come along, join me on this awesome new journey! </h3>

						Chile, my home country, boasts a geography defined by its elongated and narrow shape, which
						significantly influences its weather patterns. The diverse landscapes, rich traditions,
						architectural marvels, and captivating narratives weave together into a vibrant tapestry.
					</p>
					<p>
						During my upbringing, I found myself entranced by the allure of the southern regions. I
						frequently embarked on journeys to spots nestled close to the mountains, where I would spend
						weeks camping and immersing myself in the beauty of natural landscapes. Each excursion demanded
						distinct physical capabilities, as well as a sense of tranquility and patience – a remarkable
						opportunity to enhance my knowledge and self-control.
					</p>
					<p>	
						This innate passion organically drove me to arrange group camping expeditions and captivating
						stargazing sessions beneath the night sky. As my educational pursuits advanced, this inclination
						evolved into a cherished avenue for sharing the knowledge I was acquiring during my academic
						journey. These experiences stand as some of the most valuable and rewarding moments of my life.
